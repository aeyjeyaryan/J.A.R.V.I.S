## About the Project



The project features two versions of an AI named J.A.R.V.I.S, inspired by the fictional AI from the movie Iron Man. While not as sophisticated as its cinematic counterpart, the program here demonstrates significant capabilities.

## J.A.R.V.I.S


The first version, 'J.A.R.V.I.S,' is a basic program utilizing voice assistance libraries. It operates on pre-defined inputs and outputs and not generate or understand anything new.

## J.A.R.V.I.S 2.0


The second version, 'J.A.R.V.I.S 2.0,' represents a more advanced version. It incorporates Google Gemini, enabling the program to work without any strict constraints of pre-defined inputs or outputs.
