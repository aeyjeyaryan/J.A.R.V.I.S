##About the Project
The project features two versions of an AI named J.A.R.V.I.S, inspired by the fictional AI from the movie Iron Man. While not as sophisticated as its cinematic counterpart, the AI demonstrates significant capabilities.

##J.A.R.V.I.S
The first version, 'J.A.R.V.I.S,' is a basic program utilizing voice assistance libraries. It operates on pre-defined inputs and outputs, providing a foundational understanding of AI functionality.

##J.A.R.V.I.S 2.0
The second version, 'J.A.R.V.I.S 2.0,' represents a more advanced iteration. It incorporates Google Gemini, enabling the AI to operate without strict constraints on predetermined inputs and outputs. This advancement allows for more dynamic and adaptive interactions.

These projects showcase the development and exploration of AI capabilities, with 'J.A.R.V.I.S 2.0' highlighting the integration of cutting-edge technologies for enhanced functionality and flexibility.
